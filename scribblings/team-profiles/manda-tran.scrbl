  Distributed Cognition - 06/17/19

  Discussed the definition of distributed cognition as the mind not being limited to the individual.
  It includes utilizing resources from the environment (artifacts and other people).
  Distributed Cognition counters the traditional view that the mind is contained in the body.
  This article can be found @hyperlink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cognition
   here}.

  @bold{Chinese Room}

  As an example of distributed cognition we researched the Chinese Room experiment. Information about this
  can be found @hyperlink{https://www.iep.utm.edu/chineser/
   here}.

  Recognition vs Recall - 06/18/19
  
  Talked about the distinction between recognition and recall. Recognition is a more shallow understanding of a concept while recall requires a deeper understanding. We discussed this concept in terms of language specifically how the English language has subsets that require futher fluency.

  Refactoring/Broca's Region/fMRI studies - 06/19/19

  Broca's Region is much more than just the language processing area of the brain. It also deals with language comprehension and even
  muscle movements. One of the things that I found particularly interesting was the Shadow Puppets and Broca's Region experiment in which
  people studied fMRI scans of people viewing shadow puppets. This showed that Broca's Region was active, and probably has to do with human
  gesturing being included in a form of communication and the fact that mirror neurons have been found in Broca's Region.

  Ask Me Anything day with Stephen - 06/21/19

  Talked about the differences between startups and big companies as well as useful skills to
  have in the industry (referenced ThoughSTEM Assessments Handbook). Also discussed a variety of languages and programming paradigms.

  Worked on and completed out New Tactic developed in Day 4.

  Pair Programming, Map & Apply - 07/01/19
  
  Talked about pair programming and made our own examples for map, apply, and curry
  ("the power tools of functional programming").

  Pull Requests - 07/02/19
  
  Demo and practiced pull requests and finalized our examples
  for the new katas from Day 10.

  @bold{Example 1} Rotating an Ellipse
  @codeblock{
   #lang racket
   (require pict)

   (rotate (ellipse 40 80) 10)
  }
  
  @bold{Example 2} Rotating a list of Ellipses
  @codeblock{
   #lang racket
   (require pict)

   (map (curry rotate (ellipse 40 80))(range 0 120 10))
  }
  
  @bold{Example 3} Superimposing all the rotated Ellipses
  @codeblock{
   #lang racket
   (require pict)

   (apply cc-superimpose
       (map (curry rotate (ellipse 40 80))(range 0 120 10)))

  @bold{Example 4} Changing all letters in a list of strings to uppercase
  @codeblock{
   #lang racket
   (map string-upcase '("asdfjk" "eijkdf"))

  Issues/Tickets - 07/03/19
  Finished up creating examples for new katas and worked on
  new-katas-b (intermediate level katas for teaching map and apply)
                    
  @bold{Example 6}
  Create a list of alternating boolean statements.
  @codeblock{       
  #lang racket
  
  (define nums (range 20))
  (define bools (map even? nums))
  bools
  }
  
  @bold{Example 7}
  Create a  list of alternating colors.
  @codeblock{       
  #lang racket
  (require pict)
  
  (define nums (range 20))
  (define bools (map even? nums))
  (define (bools->color b)
     (if b "salmon" "midnight blue"))
  (define colors
     (map
        bools->color
        bools))
  colors    
  }
  
  @bold{Example 8}
  Create a list of color-alternating angel wings.
  @codeblock{       
  #lang racket
  (require pict)
  
  (define nums (range 20))
  (define bools (map even? nums))
