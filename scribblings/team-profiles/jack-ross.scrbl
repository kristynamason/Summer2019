  According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body
  off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

  A fascinating introduction to github and working with the terminal. We've created our bios and pushed them. I had a great sandwich from
  Judy's Cafe.

  We pushed dummy texts and then reverted them. We've created a 2htdp image of Mike Wazowski and added them to our bios.

  We created three katas for the rotate function, each with varying levels of difficulty. The easiest kata is to rotate a green ellipse by
  45 degrees. The medium kata challenges the programmer to define a function that rotates a red square by x degrees. The most difficult
  kata requires the programmer input an angle in radians and then define functions to converts radians to degrees and rotate text by that amount.

  (rotate x (square 20 "solid" "red")))

  ;Difficult Kata: "Define a function which converts an angle in radians to degrees, and use that function to construct a piece of text upside down."
